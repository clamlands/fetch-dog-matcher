# Fetch Dog Matcher

##

This is the Fetch Frontend Take-Home Exercise. On this website app, users can search from a database of shelter dogs and filter and sort their results. The user can "favorite" dogs of their choice, and finally submit their favorites list to receive a dog match for them.

## Developing

After cloning to a local repository and installing dependencies with `npm install` (or `pnpm install` or `yarn`), you can start a development server:

```bash
npm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run dev -- --open
```

## Building

To create a production version of the app:

```bash
npm run build
```

You can preview the production build with `npm run preview`.
